This project was some utility classes to help work with the [Multnomah County bridge lift API] (https://api.multco.us/bridges/docs#), specifically the Server-Sent events output at the /bridges/sse endpoint. Previously, you could see the county's overview page at https://multco.us/it/multnomah-county-bridge-alerts for more details and to fill out the access request form if desired, but the API was discontinued and the documentation is no longer available
