This project is some utility classes to help work with the [Multnomah County bridge lift API] (https://api.multco.us/bridges/docs#), specifically the Server-Sent events output at the /bridges/sse endpoint. See the county's overview page at https://multco.us/it/multnomah-county-bridge-alerts for more details and to fill out the access request form if desired.

Work-in-progress, but it does most of what I need already. Scope might expand to cover the other API endpoints if needed.
